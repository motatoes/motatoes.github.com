When people get bored, they usually do something fun. When I get bored, I write a new blog post.
</p>

<p>
So yesterday, I was working on an assignment which was a C++ program. I had code similar to this:
</p>

<pre>
 #include&lt;iostream&gt;
 using namespace std;

int main()
 {
 char x[10];
 int y;

cout&lt;&lt;&quot;Enter a number&quot;;
 cin&gt;&gt;y;
 cout&lt;&lt;&quot;Enter a string&quot;;
 cin.getline(x,9);

system(&quot;PAUSE&quot;);
 }
</pre>

<p>
Okay, so its pretty simple. I'm asking for a integer from the keyboard, and then i need a char[]. I'm using "getline" because I wanted to count spaces as well.
</p>

<p>
Should have worked ... but it didn't:
</p>

<p>
After I enter the number and press ENTER, it doesn't ask me for the next input.
</p>
<p>
ZOMG what happened! Why does it skip the.getline and terminate the program? That question kept haunting me for a while... Until I found out why. I found the answer on this site called <a title="sol" href="http://mathbits.com/mathbits/compsci/APstrings/APgetline.htm" target="_blank">mathbits</a>
</p>

<p>
So it turns out that the "cin" input steam function ignored the trailing "\n" in the input stream ...
</p>

<p>
The getline on the other hand, keeps reading until it FINDS a "\n" ... See how that works?
</p>
<p>
Since the previous "Cin" kept a trailing "\n", the getline found it and thought it was the end of the input!
</p>

<h4>Â Solution</h4>
<p>
The solution is well presented on <a title="sol" href="http://mathbits.com/mathbits/compsci/APstrings/APgetline.htm" target="_blank">mathbits </a>as well.
</p>
<h5>plan A</h5>
<p>
One solution is to use cin.ignore(100,'\n'). This ignores up to a 100 characters in the stream, until it meets a "\n" .
</p>

<pre>
 #include&lt;iostream&gt;
 using namespace std;

int main()
 {
 char x[10];
 int y;

cout&lt;&lt;&quot;Enter a number: &quot;;
 cin&gt;&gt;y;
 cout&lt;&lt;&quot;Enter a string: &quot;;
 cin.ignore(100,'\n');//!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!//
 cin.getline(x,9);

system(&quot;PAUSE&quot;);
 }
</pre>


<h5>Plan B</h5>
<p>
Another solution is to use a dummy string variable to absorb the nasty \n :
</p>

<pre>
 #include&lt;iostream&gt;
 using namespace std;

int main()
 {
 char x[10];
 char dummy[2]; //!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!//
 int y;

cout&lt;&lt;&quot;Enter a number: &quot;;
 cin&gt;&gt;y;
 cout&lt;&lt;&quot;Enter a string: &quot;;
 cin.getline(dummy,1); //!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!//
 cin.getline(x,9);
 cout&lt;&lt;x;
 system(&quot;PAUSE&quot;);
 }
</pre>

<p>
Well done! You have now managed to overcome the \n getline problem.
