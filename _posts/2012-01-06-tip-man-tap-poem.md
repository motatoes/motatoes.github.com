summary: Tip man tap is an imaginary charachter that symbolises somebody who keeps tipping and tapping on his keyboard to server the community. Just a simple poem I wrote to show how much some people devote out of their time and money.

Tip man tap
###########

Tip man tap, tip man tap

tip man tap and his enery packs

All the people are sleeping

and the night is just beginning

but our friend still has commitments to finish

--------------------------------------

He's not sure how long it's gonna take

But he can't stop now and take a break

There bugs that he must fix now right away

-----------------------------------------

Tip man tap hates parties

Cause there are other ways for pleasure

Tip man tap prefers hard work over leisure

------------------------------------------

They call him a programmer

But he calls himself a hacker

A hacker likes to play around and try

-------------------------------------

He considers it like his destiny

Working for the sake of humanity

Cause life is not devoted for fun and games

---------------------------------------

And as the first sun ray hits his room

Tip man's still tapping in his dorm

He's about to go to bed but there commitments to finish

He's about to go to bed but there commitments to finish

He's about to go to bed but there commitments to finish......
