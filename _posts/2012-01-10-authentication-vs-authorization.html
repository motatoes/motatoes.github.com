I'm writing this post for my own reference, because I always tend to forget
<h4>Authentication</h4>
Authentication is the means of ensuring that a user is he who claims to be. Most common means of authentication is "login" system.
<h4>Authorization</h4>
Authorization answers the question "Can the user perform <em>foo</em> action on my system" ?

Based on the answer, we either perform or reject the action. So authorization ensures that a user is allowed to perform an action on the system ... So a user authenticates himself, then based on that , we may decide the actions he may or may not perform (Authorization)

More information <a title="more info" href="http://www.duke.edu/~rob/kerberos/authvauth.html">here</a>.
