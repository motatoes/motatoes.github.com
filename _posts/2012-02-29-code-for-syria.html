Bloody horror .. torture, mass-killing , heavy bombing, kidnapping, Syria is truly bleeding, and it needs help.

It's traumatizing every part of me, knowing that innocent people are dying . This has nothing to do with race, religion, or ethnicity.  Those are real people just like you and me. Just remember, it could have been your dad, your daughter, or your mother. If you're not sure what i'm talking about, see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvwInZm5Eeg">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%E2%80%932012_Syrian_uprising">here</a> and <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503543_162-20057082-503543.html">here</a> and here.

And it seems like there's nothing that I can do -- or can I? But I'm just good at programming, how can I help the Syrians just by that? I'm not sure, but I'm willing to find out.

I'm starting <a href="http://www.code4syria.co.cc">this</a> website (code for Syria) to figure out the ways in which I and other programmers can help to  stop the bloodshed and genocide in Syria. They say need is the mother of invention, AND THEY NEED OUR HELP. <a title="Code for syria campaign" href="http://www.code4syria.co.cc"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-178" title="C4S" src="http://www.sanddevelopers.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/C4S-300x145.png" alt="" width="300" height="145" /></a>

If you're a programmer, please think about ways in which your code can help the Syrian people. If not, You can still suggest ways in which we can help, <strong>Every suggestion counts</strong>.

<a href="http://www.dearbashar.co.cc">This </a>is my first project. It's called "dear bashar" (not so dear after all). Through it, I aim at spreading awareness about what the general public thinks about Bashar Al-Assad. This is by sending virtual messages to the president, like it's going to land in his private inbox. Please send a message! Meanwhile, I'm thinking of other applications and websites that <em>might help</em>.

Pray for Syria.

Cheers.
