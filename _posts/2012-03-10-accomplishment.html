"(Would you rather) sell sugar water for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world" -- Steve jobs.
If you'd rather go with Steve, carry on reading, otherwise, you may switch to something else.
This is not going to be an article about changing the world, neither is it about success stories from great people. 
Ask someone what he likes to do most, and you'll get a wide variety of answers. An interesting observation though, is that usually our jobs / majors do not reflect what we love to do most. This might be because there are no jobs related to what we do. Or maybe it is because we prefer to keep it as some thing tertiary, that we only do in our free time. In the harsh real world, our expectations tend to fall far bellow reality. 
Which takes us back to the introductory quote. We could either "change the world" to suite our desires, or simply go with the flow.
