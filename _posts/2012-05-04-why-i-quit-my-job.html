<strong>update</strong> we won first place in the contest!!!!!! We bought the trophies home with us!
</p>

<p>
I quit my job last week. You're probably wondering: did I even get a job in the first place? Actually yes.
</p>

<p>
I had a job as a JavaScript programmer for a telecom company, but they also had me do some PHP later on. Work was fun!!!!!! And you probably wonder again : why did I quit after a month? Why did I quit my job! Well several reasons. And that's exactly what this post is about
</p>

<h2>1- working for somebody</h2>

<p>
Working under someone might have its own virtues:
</p>

<p>
<strong>1-</strong> it's safer and less risky (and more boring)
</p>

<p>
<strong>2-</strong> nice environment, fixed working hours and not much stress (but stress is a good thing)
</p>

<p>
I liked what I did in the job, but that whole working for someone else thing didnt appeal to me . It just sounded ... Wrong.
</p>

<p>
Why can't I do all this work on my own? And earn 10 times as much. Why can't I be my own boss ? Why can't I take an adventurous journey and do something 10x as fun?
</p>

<p>
Of course the problem here was, I didn't know anything about enterpreunership.i wasn't going to make that decision unless I had 2 things:
</p>

<p>
<strong>1 - </strong> a partner to share some of the risk
</p>

<p>
<strong>2 -</strong> an opportunity, and a mentor to guide me through the start stage
</p>

<p>
And this leads us to the next heading.
</p>

<h2>2- An appoutunity</h2>

<p>
So I already had this super talented graphics designer friend. He's been planning his startup for a while now. It was on pause state anyway. But then Something happened that made us initiate the idea.
</p>
<p>
A competition held by <a title="The tamkeen page" href="http://www.lf.bh/en/">tamkeen </a>was announced. Its called: <a title="Mashroo3i page" href="http://mashroo3i.bh">mashroo3i</a>, which is Arabic for "my business" (actually it also translates to "My project" but oh well)
</p>
<p>
So here we are in front of this competition where you participate with your business idea and then have mentors guide you all the way until you have yourself a business prototype, and maybe win a cup and investments)
</p>
<p>
And so here I was, in front of a great opportunity. I could have resumed my job and the contest together, but I preferred to stay focused and quit the job.
</p>
<p>
One other reason why I quit the job is to depend more on the idea of having my business and hence, devote more for it. If I had another "safe" job, it wouldn't work out very well. But now I'm in this win-win situation, so losing is not a choice. It's been lots of fun for a week now, and it feels good. Oh and while we're at it please like this <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MustGraphics4M">facebook fanpage </a>for me!
</p>
<p>
So I finally took the leap step and I don't care what happens now. So , what are YOU waiting for?
