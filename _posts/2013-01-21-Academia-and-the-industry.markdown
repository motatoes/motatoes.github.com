A friend of mine has recently graduated. I asked him what his future plans are, [to which he responded that he was interested in doing an M.Sc.](https://twitter.com/MRi1101/status/292940140727394305). He was asking me about my opinion for whether or not he should proceed with an M.Sc. in his specialization, or just do a Master in Business administration. I've been thinking about sharing my thoughts on research and academia for a while now, so I took it as a chance to write this blog post and share it with him, and the rest of the world.

Academic dogma (?)

What's dogma?
